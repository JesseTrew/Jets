## Jets Project

### Week 3 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

You are going to create a fleet of jets with different capabilities. Your application will be a menu to use your jets and access information about them.

### How to Run
Run from the file JetsApplication. Follow on-screen prompts and input requested data.

### Technologies/Topics Used
This program utilizes many of the topics and technologies that we have learned so far in these first three weeks. The most recent of these is Lists. For this project we needed to manipulate information in a list, as well as incorporate interfaces, abstract classes, and encapsulation.


### Lessons Learned
First, I think the UML diagrams are super useful. It really helps me keep track of everything nicely.

Secondly, I do not like Scanner. Perhaps because I just don't understand it well. It gave me a lot of trouble. Reference line 188 for one example of this. I tried many different workarounds, but still the program would not like it if the 'model' String prompted on line 188 was input containing spaces. That's just one example of my issues with Scanner in this program. I'm not too worried about this, however, as I've been assured by our instructors that we won't be seeing Scanner again after a week or two from now. And the program works as is, even if it's not in the prettiest way.

The other important takeaways I have with this project are mostly psychological/mental. For one, I'm increasingly finding that I do very much enjoy the puzzle-solving aspect of coding. It's rewarding and satisfying intellectually to complete objectives that require some serious critical thinking.

Also, this weekend I was unable to come in on Saturday and take advantage of our weekend teachers' help. So I was left to my own devices in completing the project. Although at times I was stumped on some points, I found that if I just keep my cool and look at the problem objectively, I can figure it out. Of course that's with referencing our course material and online resources when necessary.

Either way, it's reassuring that if I silence the doubting internal voice and just calmly approach the stumbling blocks with time and consideration, the solution will present itself. Regardless, I do intend to come in on future Saturdays when able.

### Final Thoughts

My work's not perfect, but it's sufficiently functional, as far as I can tell. We'll see what our instructors have to say about that.
